Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start this endeavour, and I hope that this will be the first of many posts that I'll be writing.

## Me

My name is Nathaniel, but I usually go by _nize_ online. I'm an aspiring game developer who loves exploring different technologies and skills. As of writing this post, I'm in my second year of college pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, and my current focus is on web development with TypeScript. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, creating pixel art, and watching various TV shows.

## Redesigning my site

I have always considered myself to be a back-end developer due to my limited front-end skills. However, I recently started playing around with Tailwind CSS, which made my front-end work easier and helped me redesign [chessu](https://github.com/nizewn/chessu). This gave me the opportunity to revamp [my old website](http://old.nize.ph), which wasn't very user-friendly, only contained some basic information due to a lack of space, and was quite boring to look at.

Along with Tailwind CSS, I rewrote my site using three highly-performant frameworks: **SolidStart**, **Qwik**, and **Astro**. I settled on Astro for various reasons, which I may write more about in a future post.

## Why I started this blog

Although I've never been one to share my thoughts on personal or political topics, I'm very passionate about technology. I added a blog section to my website so that I could have a platform to share my thoughts and insights with the industry. I'm excited to explore various topics related to technology, such as software development, game design, and more.

## My goals

One of my goals as a developer is to contribute to the open-source community. I hope to participate in other projects and create my own open-source software that people will find useful. It's a rewarding feeling to be able to give back to the community that has taught me so much.

I'm also interested in game development. I've played around with the Godot Engine in the past, and I hope to revisit this in the future to create my own games.

## What I'll be writing about

Since I'm still in the early stages of my journey, I'll be writing mostly about my learning experience and progress with my projects. In the future, I hope to write tutorials on topics I'm confident in.

I'm not good at writing lengthy amounts of text, but I'll do my best to keep my posts informative and concise. I'm also very busy, so I may not write very often. For now, I aim to publish at least three posts a year.

Learning new skills and exploring different technologies is something that excites me, and I hope to inspire others to do the same. Thanks for reading, and I look forward to sharing more with you in the future.
